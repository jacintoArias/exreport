<h2>Made for Researchers by Researchers</h2>
<p>
This projects was started as an utility collection of useful tools and scripts
developed by a group of PhD students, to agilize and enhacing the process of publishing
scientific papers. Later on, motivated by the utility of the toolbox the project
was enriched  by proposing a methodology aiming for a total reproducibility of
the results and error free research.
<br/>
<br/>
We believe in the potential of this toolbox and wish that it would serve to others
in the same situation and is our desire to share it with the community. Please check
the <a href="getstarted.hmtl">get started</a> and <a href="examples.html">examples</a>
sections to check it this package can be useful for your work.

a development stage. The current beta version could suffer modifications that
will change the current syntax, deprecating some functions.
