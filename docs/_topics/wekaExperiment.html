      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>A problem containing experimental data obtaining by comparing several instances
of Machine Algorithms from the Weka library. The variables are as follows:</p>

    </div>

    <div class="Details">
      <h2>Details</h2>

      <p><ul>
<li> method. Classification algorithms used in the experimen (NaiveBayes, J48, IBk)
  </li>
<li> problem. Problems used as benchmark in the comparison, up to 12.
  </li>
<li> featureSelection. Boolean parameter indicating if the data was preprocessed
  </li>
<li> fold. For each configuration a 10-fold cross validation was performed. This variable is a numeric value ranging from 1 to 10.
  </li>
<li> accuracy. This is a measure of the performance of each algorithm. Representing the percentage of correctly classified instances.
  </li>
<li> trainingTime. A second measure of performance. This one indicates the time in seconds that took the algorithm to build the model.
</li>
</ul></p>
