- title: Experimental Data Manipulation
  description: "<p>This functions manipulate the experiment objects, implementing
           common data manipulation operations, such as subseting and joining.
           In addition, there are a number of available functions to sanitize
           and preprecessing the experimental data such as looking for duplicated
           entries, reducing parameters and instantiating the methods with the
           parameters.</p>
