<h3>About the authors:</h3>
<p>
This project was born as a collaboration between two Machine Learning PhD students
in the <a href="http://www.dsi.uclm.es/simd/" target="_blank">Intelligent Sistems and Data Mining Group</a>
at the University of Castilla-La Mancha in

It started as a simple idea trying to make a compilation of a bunch of useful
R scripts that were develop to agilize the experiment analysis of their publications.
Later on, they decided to share the idea with the rest of the research group components
and motivated for the good reception they began the developing of this R package, to be
shared with the community.

<p>
The Intelligent Systems and Data Mining ( SIMD ) research group was born in
2000 under the direction of José Antonio Gámez Martín and José Miguel Puerta Callejón,
and is part of the Computer Systems Department of the University of Castilla-La Mancha.

Their main research is focused on:
<ul>
<li>Data Mining and Machine Learning: Knowledge Discovery and its applications
as Bayesian networks, decision trees and rule-based systems.</li>
<li>Decision Making systems under conditions of uncertainty: probabilistic expert
systems ( Bayesian networks ), fuzzy rule-based systems</li>
<li>Metaheuristics and evolutionary computation: genetic algorithms, ant colonies, distribution estimation algorithms,
and its application in combinatorial optimization and search problems.</li>
<li>Mobile robotics: localization algorithms for mobile robots and image processing for object recognition</li>
<li>Multimodal interaction: multimodal communication mechanisms for social robots.</li>
</ul>
