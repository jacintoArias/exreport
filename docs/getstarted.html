<h2>A framework for the reproducible analysis and communication of scientific
experimental results</h2>
<p>
In this section we introduce the theoretical foundations and research behind
development of this framework. This is a summary of a <strong>scientific paper</strong>
still on developent for this idea:
</p>
<blockquote>J. Arias and J. CÃ³zar. A framework for the reproducible analysis and communication of scientific
experimental results. University of Castilla-La Mancha. Unpublished.</blockquote>
<br/>
<p>
In this work we introduce a series of concepts in order to define a methodology
to perform the analysis and communication of research experimental results emphasizing
reproducibility and error avoidance.
</p>
<p>
The <i>exreport</i> package responds to the methodology defined in this work and
allow to easily implement the different steps discussed, these include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment definition</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data modeling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Statistical testing validation</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>

<h3>Experiment definition</h3>
<p>
The key point of the methodology that we propose is based on the fact that the
objectives pursued for a series of scientific experiments must be fixed previous
to the actual execution of the experiments and adquisition of the data.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, it is likely that the scientific process is iterative in its
nature, and that trial and error is one of the most popular approaches. So this
methodology also allows extending and repeating our analysis looking for the maximum
grade of reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
From now on we assume that the source of our experimental data is unknown to us,
and we only have a model of such data, that we will use to define the goals of our
experiment and then iterate to the proposed workflow to perform the analysis and
obtain interpretable output that can be shared with the community.
</p>

<br/>
<img class="center-block" src="img/workflow.svg" alt="A graphical representation of the methodology workflow" style="width:80%;"/>
<br/>

<p>
Defining our experiment has two different phases: First, the properties and structure
of the data must be defined in order to assure that our analysis methodology will be
consistent over multiple iterations. Second, we define the validation process and the
outputs that we would like to obtain for our publications.
</p>
<p>
The proposed R package <i>exreport</i> that we present is focused on performing
this particular task.
</p>
<br/>

<a id="dataModel"></a>
<h3>Data modeling</h3>
<p>
Researchers use a wide range of sources for digital experimental data adquisition:
i.e. different dedicated hardware and software, programming languages, etc.
</p>
<p>
In order to provide an unified pipeline for our analysis platform we have chosen
a particular data model from which several transformation operations can be performed
to assure consistency at the same time of elasticity.
</p>
<p>
To specify a data model it is important to define the basic elements that
compose an experiment. Initially, an experiment is performed by applying a
particular <strong>method</strong> to a <strong>problem</strong>, these being
our basic components of our model. The output of such experiment will be given
by a series of <strong>outputs</strong>. Finally, our methods can be optionally
parametrized by a set of <strong>parameters</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Given the combination of the previous elements, we define out data model as a
collection of experiments composed by a method, a dataset, one or more outputs,
and optionally, a number of parameters. This particular model, can be easily
represented by a columnar structure such as the R language <code>data.frame</code>;
in fact, <i>exreport</i> experiment representation is an encapsulation of this
particular data structure.
</p>

<table class="table" alt="Tabular representation of an general experiment data.frame">
<tr><th>Method</th> <th>Problem </th><th> Parameter<sup>1</sup> </th><th> ... </th><th> Parameter<sup>i</sup> </th><th> Output<sup>1</sup> </th><th> ... </th><th> Output<sup>o</sup></th></tr>
<tr><td>M<sub>1</sub> </td><td> P<sub>1</sub> </td><td> Par<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup> </td><td> ... </td><td> Par<sub>1</sub><sup>i</sup> </td><td> Out<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup> </td><td> ... </td><td> Out<sub>1</sub><sup>o</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>... </td><td> ... </td><td> ... </td><td> ... </td><td> ... </td><td> ... </td><td> ... </td><td> ...</td></tr>
<tr><td>M<sub>m</sub> </td><td> P<sub>p</sub> </td><td> Par<sub>a</sub><sup>1</sup> </td><td> ... </td><td> Par<sub>b</sub><sup>i</sup> </td><td> Out<sub>c</sub><sup>1</sup> </td><td> ... </td><td> Out<sub>d</sub><sup>o</sup></td></tr>
</table>
<br/>

<p>
The main property of this format is its elasticity, as it allows the addition of
new entries using new methods, or using existing ones on new problems. This can be
done seamessly if they follow the same format. In addition, this format can
be altered, by including new parameters or outputs extending the existing configurations;
in general a wide range of transformations can be done to the format (Please
refer to the exreport description or documentation for particular examples).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> <i>exreport</i> ships with converter utilities for
transforming other common data formats to our proposal.
</p>

<br/>
<a id="statisticalTests"></a>
<h3>Statistical testing validation</h3>

<p>
When it comes to validate a series of experimental results we can find a wide
range of methods, from traditional statistical tests to descriptive analytics.
In the literature we can find several approaches of validation methodologies,
given the scope in which this project was developed, our proposal is based on
a series of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> papers that were accepted as a standard. We believe
that a generalization of these methodologies can be applied to other areas of
expertise as they are based on sound statistical procedures an isolate the problem
to a general problem that can be associated with the proposed data model. Concretelly:

</blockquote>

<p>
This methodology includes different tests given the properties of the source problem:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Paired Comparison:</strong> In this case, two different methods
are compared given the set of evaluated problems for a given output.
In this case, the statistical test performed is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test">Wilcoxon signed rank test</a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple Comparison:</strong> In this case, more than two
methods must be compared for the set of problems for a given output.
The test of choice is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_test">Friedman ranks test</a>.
In addition to this test the methodology proposes to perform a post-hoc
analysis, according to the cited bibliography we distinguish two cases that
can be employed:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Control test:</strong> In this test all methods are compared
    to the method that has obtained the best mean rank given the target output
    variable. It is recommended when we want to determine if a proposal
    outperforms the existing ones. A Holm's post-hoc procedure is applied
    as explained in
    <a href="http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/Demsar06.pdf">(DemÅ¡ar 2006)</a>.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pairwise test:</strong> In this test all methods are compared
    to each other. It is recommenteded when we want to determine the best
    suited method regarding the overall performance for the given benchmark.
    A Shaffer's post-hoc procedure is applied as described in
    <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francisco_Herrera/publication/254306218_An_Extension_on_Statistical_Comparisons_of_Classifiers_over_Multiple_Data_Sets_for_all_Pairwise_Comparisons/links/00463536d312be4a11000000.pdf">(GarcÃ­a 2008)</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
All this tests assume that the methods have been instantiated by a particular
configuration of their parameters. In addition, we believe that additional metrics
can be of use when evaluating our results, for that we include several descriptive
statistics techniques in our framework that we recommend to add to the final reports
for a considerable enrichment of the validation process. (Refer to the examples
and the documentation for a detailed).
</p>

<br/>
<h3>Automatic Report Generation and Reproducibility</h3>
<p>
As we stated before, the final purpose of the methodology is to obtain a compact
report of the defined analysis. By generating an exreport script in <i>R</i>, we
are defining the goals to achieve with our experiments and we can thus perform or repeat
the analysis and obtain the results iteratively by increasing and modifying our data model.
</p>
<p>
Our graphical and interactive generated reports are intended to serve as final
elements of scientific quality publications so the process of writing a paper
can be enhaced by allowing the author to <strong>refresh</strong> the plots,
figures and analytic conclusions of the manuscript interactively.
</p>
<p>
Finally, if this software and its methodology succeeds, it can serve as a
sharing utility between researchers, allowing the direct transference of
experimental data to invite others to replicate, check and extends our conclusions.
