## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Avoided the use of data frame column names as variables (as it is usually done in aes
  environment of the package ggplot2. Instead, we specify them as string values.

## Test environments
* MAC OS X 10, R 3.1.2
* Ubuntu 14.04, R 3.2.2
* Windows 10, R 3.2.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
  We did not run checks on downstream dependencies, because there were no behaviour modifying changes to the code.
